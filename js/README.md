# Mosh JavaScript Courses

This repository contains my code from the [Code With Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com) JavaScript Basics and OOP courses.

### Installation

Nothing, just install from git and read the files.

### Usage

If you are using VSCode, you can "Go Live" and uncomment modules in index.js. Otherwise look at the Console for output.

### Contributing

You are welcome to contribute provided you accept the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CONTRIBUTING.md).

That being said, these are my notes from when I did the course, so maybe you just want to clone and keep your own changes? I won't mind, but I'm always open to learning new things.

### Acknowledgements

- Mosh Hamedani is an excellent instructor. I highly these courses if you are learning JavaScript. They are not free, but I found the education well worth the price of admission.
